           <h1>Shark on the Grill</h1>

<p>The most popular way to cook shark involves firing up the grill. You can barbecue nice, thick shark steaks just as you would swordfish or salmon. Shark is a lean meat without a lot of fat, so you may want to marinate the meat for an hour or two before putting it on the fire to help it stay moist and tender. You can also par-cook it in a little warm milk, wine, water or broth for three to four minutes before grilling to help it along.

To grill the perfect shark steak, place the meat on the hottest part of the grill and sear each side for two minutes, creating nice grill marks and good color. Move the steaks to a cooler part of the grill and cook for another four to five minutes on each side. Keep seasonings simple by using citrus, fresh herbs, minced garlic, or ginger.</p>
